We use this folder to store `@font-face` fonts, both custom fonts (like "Open Sans" "for example) and icons.

For icons, use [Icomoon](http://icomoon.io) to generate your font, name it `icons` and make sure to include the JSON export along with it. This means you will find the following files:

- `/public/assets/fonts/icons.eot`
- `/public/assets/fonts/icons.json`
- `/public/assets/fonts/icons.svg`
- `/public/assets/fonts/icons.ttf`
- `/public/assets/fonts/icons.woff`
